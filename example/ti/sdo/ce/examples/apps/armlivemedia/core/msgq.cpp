/*
 *  ======== msgq.c ========
 *  This program demostrates MessageQ on a single processor.
 *
 *  This example has a single server Task that receives requests
 *  and responds back. The server Task receives requests via its
 *  MessageQ queue.
 *
 *  There are 3 clients Tasks. Each client creates its own MessageQ queue. 
 *  Each client opens the server's queue and sends a request. In each
 *  message is the reply queue. This allows the server to determine who
 *  to reply to (instead of doing an explicit MessageQ_open).
 *
 *  Each client allocates one message. This message is also used
 *  by the server to send the response. This is possible because 
 *  the content is the same size. Another option is to have the 
 *  server free the message and allocate a new one. Even another 
 *  option would to use MessageQ_staticMsgInit and not have any heaps.
 *  Please refer to the restrictions with MessageQ_staticMsgInit for
 *  more details.
 *
 *  Initially, each client places its arg0 value into the message 
 *  (e.g. clientTask0's arg0 is 0, etc). When the server receives the
 *  request, it simply adds NUMCLIENTS to the message id. This allows
 *  better validation that the message is being returned to the proper
 *  client.
 *
 *  Each client calls Task_sleep(arg0) to add a little variability 
 *  into the example. The example ends after each client sends NUMMSGS
 *  messages.
 *
 *  The server queue was created statically and the clients dynamically 
 *  to show the functionality. The names for the clients queues are not
 *  needed since no one attempts to open them.
 *
 *  See message.k file for expected output.
